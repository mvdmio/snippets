# Resharper

In this folder you'll find my personal Resharper settings file.
This file contains all the Resharper formatting rules I prefer for each language I use.

I would recommend to import these settings into your team-shared configuration (Solution.sln.DotSettings). 
You can read about this in the Resharper documentation [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Sharing_Configuration_Options.html#solution-team-shared-layer).
